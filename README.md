# Cineflix
CineFlix is a Movie management application(Similar to BookMyShow) developed using react in frontend and express in backend(Nodejs Framework). This application is deployed in Heroku. I deployed server files and client files on a single server but in local pc, I ran server in localhost:8080 and client in localhost:3000 .  MySQL database is used

You might get application error on clicking this link.It is because if there is no requests from the server for sometime(3hrs), MySQL database will stop. This problem can be resolved by reloading my server in herokuapp so that it will send request and MYSQL database will start to run. No problem with the code
